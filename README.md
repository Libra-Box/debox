## About
**Libra is a decentralized private cloud storage based on IPFS. Its biggest difference from traditional private storage is:**

- For the change of storage mode, Libra adopts the partition storage scheme based on IPFS
- The traditional account password login mode is cancelled. The APP adopts the QR code login mode. Users only need to save their QR code keys to ensure data security
- Libra allows data backup between each terminal node
- Libra supports data backup to the Filecoin network
- Libra supports Dapp deployment of Web3.0
- Libra supports the data distribution of PCDN and can serve as a gateway to provide external data retrieval services
- It supports the proxy mode and can serve as a proxy node for other intranet nodes
